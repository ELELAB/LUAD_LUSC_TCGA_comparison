Here it is possible to compare the DEGs in LUAD and LUSC and identify the ones unique to each lung cancer type.
1) VennDiagram_LUAD-LUSC.R script creates venn diagrams (png format) in order to get LUAD and LUSC specific DEGs. Up- and down-regulated genes are separated. An overlap file and two no-overlap files (both txt format) were generated by the script. The first one includes all the common genes between two lung subtypes and the others two contain no-common genes, one for LUAD and one for LUSC.
