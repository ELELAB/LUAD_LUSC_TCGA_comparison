1) VennDiagram_LUAD-LUSC.R script creates venn diagrams (png format) in order to get LUAD and LUSC specific DEGs. Up- and down-regulated genes are separated. An overlap file and two no-overlap files (both txt format) were generated by the script. The first one includes all the common genes between two lung subtypes and the others two contain no-common genes, one for LUAD and one for LUSC.

2) reactome folder includes all the results from the pathway enrichment analysis.
