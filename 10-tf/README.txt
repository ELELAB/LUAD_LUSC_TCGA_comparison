In this folder the script and steps to analyse transcription factors - target network in the coexpression modules are illustrated 
The user need to have the output from the step 8-coexpression already performed.

We also provided the output after running the scripts as a reference
Before running the scripts the user need to have the proper structure of sub-directories in place - comments are provided about this within the scripts.

The scripts to be run are, in order:
(1) aggregate_TFvsTARGET_modules_LUSC.R
