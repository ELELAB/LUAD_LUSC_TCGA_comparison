In this folder we include the script to extract the list of LUAD-specific and LUSC-specific DE genes.
The folders paired unpaired and all need to be copied by the previous step 3-consensus_DEA

To extract the list run the scripts:
(1) comparison_LUAD_vs_LUSC.R
(2) in the folder final_gene_list another README file is available with the steps to get the final list of genes, as well as pathway enrichment and GO-enrichment analyses
