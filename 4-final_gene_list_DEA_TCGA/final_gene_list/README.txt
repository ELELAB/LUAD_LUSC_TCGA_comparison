1) clean_genes_list.R script gets the final list of up- and down-regulated genes for LUAD and LUSC for a specific dataset. Basically we removed further genes in common between LUAD and LUSC detected by different dataset (example: we removed common up-regulated genes between LUAD paired and LUSC all).

2) percentage_common_genes.R script calculates the percentage of common genes between all and paired dataset. 

3) pathway_analysis folder includes all the scripts and results from the pathways enrichment analysis.

4) GOanalysis folder includes all the scripts and results from the GO enrichment analysis.
